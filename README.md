# Kaggle Solutions

## Contributing
Many competitions are missing links to their solutions, evaluation and type.

To contribute:
 - Fork the repo
 - Edit the **competitions.yaml** file (you can even edit it with Github's editor)
 - Make a pull request

For each competition missing the data, please add `types` and `solutions`.

The solutions should be links to the Kaggle forum (if possible) or blog posts.

For instance, you might add:

    types:
      - "Speech recognition"
    solutions:
      -
        label: "1st place solution"
        url: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/discussion/46988"
      -
        label: "2nd place solution"
        url: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/discussion/47715"
      -
        label: "3rd place solution"
        url: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/discussion/47722"
